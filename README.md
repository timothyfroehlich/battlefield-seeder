Goal: This script was made to automate seeding of Battlefield Servers. It will:

Join a server automatically if there are less than the minimum number of players in the server (default 36)
After joining, will minimize the game so that it takes less resources
Leave the server automatically if there are more than the maximum number of players in the server (default 64)
Prompt you whether you want to launch or leave the game before it does so, and do it anyways if you don't respond in time (5 and 10 seconds respectively)
